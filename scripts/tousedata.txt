The data is on:

/data2/jmckinne/<modelname>

where <modelname> is one of:

modelname='thickdisk7 thickdisk8 thickdisk11 thickdisk12 thickdisk13 run.like8 thickdiskr7 thickdiskrr2 thickdisk16 thickdisk5 thickdisk14 thickdiskr1 thickdiskr2 thickdisk9 thickdiskr3 thickdisk17 thickdisk10 thickdiskr15 thickdisk3 thickdiskhr3 runlocaldipole3dfiducial blandford3d_new sasham9full2pi sasham5 sasham2 sasha0 sasha1 sasha2 sasha5 sasha9b25 sasha9b50 sasha9b100 sasha9b200 sasha99'

These are the same models (in order) that appear in the MTB12 paper, but here using "internal" names.  Some directories are links to other locations (like /data1/jmckinne), so be careful when changing dirs.

The data files are in <modelname>/dumps/fieldline*.bin and <modelname>/dumps/gdump.bin . They have a 1 line text header with a line break and then a binary data block.

The gdump and fieldline files have header of:

tsteppartf, realtotalsize[1], realtotalsize[2], realtotalsize[3], realstartx[1], realstartx[2], realstartx[3], dx[1], dx[2], dx[3],localrealnstep,gam,a,R0,Rin,Rout,hslope,localdt,defcoord,MBH,QBH,is,ie,js,je,ks,ke,whichdump,whichdumpversion,numcolumns

The gdump data block has (written in C-order, so that last index is fastest) "numcolumns" columns of:

{ijk}^i X^i V^i \Gamma^\mu_{\nu\tau}     g^{\mu\nu} g_{\mu\nu}  \sqrt{-g} \gamma_\mu dV^\mu/dX^\nu

where {ijk} are indices for internal uniform coordinates X^i (going from realstartx[1,2,3] to realtotalsize[1,2,3]*dx[1,2,3]) that map onto spherical polar coordinates V^i with transformation dV^\mu/dX^\nu.

The field line data block is has "numcolumns" columns of:

\rho_0, u_g, -u_t, -T^r_t/(\rho_0 u^r), u^t, v^r, v^\theta, v^\phi, B^r, B^\theta, B^\phi, [3 more things as \detg B^i for sasha models, check "numcolumns" in header]

where u^i = v^i u^t is the lab-frame 4-velocity that satisfies u.u=-1.  B^i are the lab-frame 3-field with fluid 4-field as b^\mu = B^\nu P_\nu^\mu/u^t where P_\nu^\mu = \delta_\nu^\mu + u_\nu u^\mu is a projection tensor.

I suggest using the gdump's {ijk}, X, V, \sqrt{-g}, dV/dX in order to take the "fieldline" data and get it into whatever coordinates you like (Cartesian Boyer-Lindquist or whatever).  The coordinates are different for all the models, and it's too hard to create data for you for special cases like we used to do.

The fieldline files have temporal gaps sometimes, so check the time (and fill-in the gap) if you need temporal information.  Note that when doing my full python-based analysis for my MTB12 paper, I only use rho,u,u^i=v^i u^t,B^i from fieldline* and {ijk}, X, V, g_{\mu\nu}, g^{\mu\nu}, \sqrt{-t}, dV/dX from gdump (that is, I don't use the connections, \Gamma...).

Feel free to ask questions.
